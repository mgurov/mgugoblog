I'm a software developer. 

My primary focus is on the delivery discipline as the way to keep the development process fit. Particularly: testing, CI/CD, clarity of code, consistency guarantees - and everything that helps to move faster without breaking too many things. 

Technologically, I'm centered around JVM backend development (Kotlin, Java). I prefer react.js for UI, and go for CLI and infra tooling.

Since 2021 I work at [iptiQ](https://iptiq.com).
