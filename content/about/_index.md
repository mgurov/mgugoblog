I'm a software developer. My focus is on the delivery discipline as the way to keep the development process fit. Particularly: testing, CI/CD, clarity of code - and everything that helps to move faster without breaking too many things. Since 2021 I work at [iptiQ](https://iptiq.com).

Technologically, I'm centered on JVM backend development (Kotlin, Java). I prefer react.js for UI, and go for CLI and infra tooling.
